It provides a user-friendly graphical interface (**Anaconda Navigator**) and package management system (**conda**) that allows developers to easily install, manage, and update Python and R packages and dependencies.\n",

    "Anaconda includes over 1,500 packages for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing, including popular packages such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**. It also comes with the **Jupyter Notebook**, a web-based interactive computing environment that enables data analysis and visualization, and **Spyder**, an integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
