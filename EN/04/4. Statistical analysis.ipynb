For example, if you wanted to know the average height of the students in your class, you would use descriptive statistics to calculate this.\n",

It allows you to draw conclusions about a larger group by analyzing a smaller group.

    "Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. It tells you how much the data is skewed or tilted to one side or the other. If the data is symmetric, the skewness will be 0. If the data is skewed to the left, the skewness will be negative. If the data is skewed to the right, the skewness will be positive.\n",

    "A percentile is a measure that tells you what percent of the values in a set of data fall below a certain value. For example, if a value is in the 90th percentile, that means that 90% of the values in the set of data are below that value. Percentiles are often used to understand the distribution of data and to compare values within the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a set of test scores {80, 85, 90, 95, 100}. To find the 50th percentile score, you would first arrange the scores in order: {80, 85, 90, 95, 100}. Then you would find the score that is greater than or equal to 50% of the other scores. In this case, the 50th percentile score is 90, because 50% of the scores are below 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentiles are often used in statistics, particularly in education and in the field of health. In education, percentiles are often used to compare student test scores to the scores of other students in the same grade. In health, percentiles are often used to compare a child's growth to the growth of other children of the same age and gender. Percentiles are also used in finance and economics to measure the performance of a stock or portfolio compared to other stocks or portfolios.\n",

For example, if you want to study the relationship between how much students study and their test scores, bivariate analysis can help you understand if there is a connection between the two.\n",

    "Correlation: Correlation is a number between -1 and 1 that shows how closely two variables are related. A correlation of 1 means that the variables are perfectly related, while a correlation of -1 means they are perfectly inversely related, and 0 means they have no relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: Regression is a method that uses data to find the best line or curve that fits the relationship between two variables.\n",

It's important to note that it helps to understand the relationship between two variables but it does not explain the cause of the relationship.\n",

For example, how studying more might impact their test scores or how getting enough sleep might affect their focus and ability to learn.
