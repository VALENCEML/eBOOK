Supervised learning \n","Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we have a dataset that includes both input data and the corresponding correct output. The goal is to train a model on this dataset, so it can make predictions about new, unseen data.\n","\n","Imagine you have a dataset of pictures of animals, and each picture is labeled with the name of the animal in the picture (e.g. \"dog\", \"cat\", \"horse\"). We can use this dataset to train a model that can take a new picture as input and predict what animal is in the picture. This is an example of supervised learning.\n","\n","Supervised learning can be used for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n","\n","During the training phase, the model is presented with many examples of images and their corresponding labels, and it learns to recognize the patterns and relationships between the images and labels. Once the model is trained, it can take a new image as input and predict the label (i.e. the animal) that corresponds to that image.\n","\n","The next example shows a simple example, how some trends can be predicted. The regression algorithms will be studied more in depth in future chapters this is just for demonstration purposes. \n","\n","We are using the linear regression algorithm which basically gives us a linear function, which in math looks like this : \n","\n","**f(x) = mx + b** \n","\n","x - input\n","\n","f - output\n","\n","m - slope \n","\n","b - intercept\n","\n"," If the algorithm gives us the intercept and the slope we can estimate the output for every input."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LbzFfFw2pfwi"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","from scipy import stats"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WFogwI_opfwl"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Generate some sample data\n","x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n","y = np.array([2, 4, 2, 5, 6])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-J5xZRtppfwl"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Train the model using the sample data\n","slope, intercept, _, _, _ = stats.linregress(x, y)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LEWxb9Zjpfwm"},"source":["The underscores ( _ ) mean that there is a return value which is not important at the moment.\n","The *linregress* function is just one possible way to calculate linear regression, an algorithm you'll learn more about in Chapter 8 of this course.

Unsupervised learning"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1INYa6ZSpfw8"},"source":["Unsupervised learning deals with problems in which the data set consists of unlabeled samples. This property is what makes it problematic for many practical applications. The absence of labels that represent the desired behavior of the model also means the absence of a solid reference point by which the quality and accuracy of the \"learned\" can be evaluated. Unsupervised learning can behave more unpredictably compared to other natural learning methods.\n","\n","In unsupervised learning, the model has to work on its own to discover patterns and information that were previously undiscovered. However, unsupervised learning algorithms allow performing more complex tasks compared to supervised learning.\n","\n","A real-life example of unsupervised learning is a child playing with blocks and discovering how they fit together to build different structures. The child is not given specific instructions or labels for the blocks, but instead explores and experiments on it's own to discover how they can be used. Similarly, a child playing with different toys and discovering how they work and what it can do with them is an example of unsupervised learning. Through these activities, the child can learn and understand it's environment without direct supervision or guidance.\n","\n","Another example is clustering, where a retail company can group customers based on their buying habits. The algorithm will analyze each customer's purchase history and group them into different clusters based on the products they tend to buy and how often they buy them. The company can then use this information to create targeted marketing campaigns for each cluster (group) of customers.\n","\n","Basically, unsupervised learning is how people learn. This behavior is more human, so it is closer to real artificial intelligence. In real applications, we do not always have labeled data, and data is not always categorized, also not every input has a corresponding output.
