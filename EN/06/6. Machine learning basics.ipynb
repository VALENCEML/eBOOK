    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that involves creating algorithms that learn from examples to solve practical problems. It involves gathering a dataset and building a statistical model from it to be used in solving the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of a practical problem that can be solved using machine learning is image classification.\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    " <li>A dataset of images, each labeled with its corresponding object class (e.g. dog, cat, car, etc.), is gathered.</li>\n",
    "<li>An algorithm is used to train a model on this dataset, which learns to recognize the features and patterns that distinguish one object class from another.</li>\n",
    "<li>Once trained, the model can be used to classify new, previously unseen images into their correct object classes.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",

    "In this case, the model is a statistical model that is built using the dataset of labeled images, and it is used to classify new images based on the learned features and patterns."

    "## 6.2. Supervised learning \n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we have a dataset that includes both input data and the corresponding correct output. The goal is to train a model on this dataset, so it can make predictions about new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset of pictures of animals, and each picture is labeled with the name of the animal in the picture (e.g. \"dog\", \"cat\", \"horse\"). We can use this dataset to train a model that can take a new picture as input and predict what animal is in the picture. This is an example of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we have a dataset that includes examples of inputs (such as images) and the corresponding correct outputs (such as labels). We use an algorithm to train a model on this dataset, so it can learn the patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be used for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the model is presented with an image and a label (e.g. \"dog\", \"cat\", \"horse\") corresponding to the animal in the image, and it learns to associate certain features of the image with the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, the model is presented with many examples of images and their corresponding labels, and it learns to recognize the patterns and relationships between the images and labels. Once the model is trained, it can take a new image as input and predict the label (i.e. the animal) that corresponds to that image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example shows a simple example, how some trends can be predicted. The regression algorithms will be studied more in depth in future chapters this is just for demonstration purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the linear regression algorithm which basically gives us a linear function, which in math looks like this : \n",
