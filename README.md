## Advancing Machine Learning and Data Science in Vocation High School Education

This repository hosts the source files for the VALENCE: Machine Learning and Data Science in Vocation High School Education lecture materials. 

The lectures have been translated to the following languages:
- English
- Macedonian
- Slovene
- Serbian

- Albanian

The different translations are stored in different folders within the repository.

To access the material you need a local working Jupyter Lab installation or you can use Google Colab through the [VALENCE website](http://www.valence-project.eu/).

## Installing Jupyter Lab

To install Jupyter Lab on a Windows machine you can use the Anaconda distribution.

For Linux we recommend using Mamba to install the `requirements.txt`.
